### Hi there, call me Max 👋

I'm one of those hybrid types of engineers who tends to uber focus on a subject for years before feeling competant.  I'm interested in entrepreneurship and run a couple websites, including <a href="https://tuneanything.com" target="_blank">tuneanything.com</a>, <a href="savvy.engineer" target="_blank">https://savvy.engineer</a>, and <a href="offrailsadventures.com" target="_blank">https://offrailsadventures.com</a>. But my real passions lie in 🚀 control theory, 🤖 machine learning, and 🔭 astronomy.

As my interests in control theory and machine learning suggest, I have an obsession with optimization; and that includes things we do in day-to-day life. You'll find a couple pinned gists below that describe projects designed to make us humans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ" target="_blank">Harder Better Faster</a>. 

I'm working towards increasing the number of pure control and machine learning projects I have to show here on Github, but for now, you can check out the Fulcrum Prop project below.  Ping me via email or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-max/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> if you want to chat!
