### Hi there, call me Max ðŸ‘‹

I'm one of those hybrid types of engineers who tends to uber focus on a subject for years before feeling competant.  I'm interested in entrepreneurship and run a couple websites, including [tuneanything.com](https://tuneanything.com), [savvy.engineer](https://savvy.engineer), and [offrailsadventures.com](https://offrailsadventures.com). But my real passions lie in ðŸš€ control theory, ðŸ¤– machine learning, and ðŸ”­ astronomy.

As my interests in control theory and machine learning suggest, I have an obsession with optimization; and that includes things we do in day-to-day life. You'll find a couple pinned gists below that describe projects designed to make us humans [Harder Better Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ){target="_blank"}. 

I'm working towards increasing the number of pure control and machine learning projects I have to show here on Github, but for now, you can check out the Fulcrum Prop project below.  Ping me via email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-max/) if you want to chat!
